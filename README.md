# Simulation_scripts
This folder contains the simulation programs written in Python to model the evolution of ideal populations under a set of scenarios, and measure the effective population size using different estimators.

Scenarios that can be tested:
- number of individuals in the population
- initial allele frequencies
- mutation rate
